# Generated Static App

This repository is generated by an automated service. It contains a static web app in the `site/` directory and a GitHub Actions workflow to publish the app to GitHub Pages.

## What’s Included

- `site/`: Static app files (HTML/JS/CSS if any)
- `LICENSE`: MIT license
- `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`: Workflow that deploys the `site/` folder to GitHub Pages on every push to `main`

## Deployment

Deployments are handled by GitHub Pages through GitHub Actions. The workflow uploads the `site/` folder as an artifact and publishes it to the `github-pages` environment.

Once published, the site is available at the repository’s Pages URL.
